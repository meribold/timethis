This module provides a context manager for measuring execution times:

```python
>>> from timethis import timethis
>>> with timethis('computing large sum'):
...     x = sum(range(10**7))
...
computing large sum: 0.203 seconds
```

Usage of `timethis` can be nested:

```python
>>> with timethis('figuring things out'):
...     with timethis('computing large sum'):
...         x = sum(range(10**7))
...     with timethis('finding some primes'):
...         y = [2] + [i for i in range(3, 10**4) if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, i // 2 + 1))]
...
| computing large sum: 0.205 seconds
| finding some primes: 0.305 seconds
figuring things out: 0.510 seconds
```

It's easy to use (for example) `logging` instead of `print`:

```python
>>> import logging
>>> with timethis('computing large sum', logging.warning):
...     x = sum(range(10**7))
...
WARNING:root:computing large sum: 0.218 seconds
```
